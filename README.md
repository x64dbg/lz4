LZ4 - Extremely fast compression
================================
LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It also features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems. A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is also provided. It trades CPU time for compression ratio.

This is an unofficial repository, aimed at creating a DLL for LZ4. The original repository can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/lz4/).
